Hello! I'm Jorge Gomes, a Brazilian Software Developer based in São Paulo. Since 2004, I’ve been crafting software with curiosity as my compass, and today I serve as a Tech Lead at a company dedicated to AI-driven solutions. My interests orbit technology, psychology, and philosophy—fields that shape how I think, build, and solve problems.
Off the clock, I dive into books and films, follow sports (and jump into the goal when I can 😁🧤), listen to music, write horror tales, practice the violin, game a little, and enjoy anime and cartoons with my daughter.
